                    <p>
                        I am fond of collecting books, both in physical and digital form,
                        but none of the applications I used so far to track my collections
                        met my expectations - Calible, Google Books, Amazon Kindle,
                        Bookshelf, etc. Some of the main pain points for me are ugly user
                        interface, lack of support for multiple platforms, file size
                        limits, narrow file format support, no ability to manage physical
                        books, notes managemens.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By developing Papyrus I aim to address these issues and add some
                        more interesting features like reading statistics, goal tracking,
                        and potentially some social systems for book borrowing.
                        Furthermore, I wish to bring this seamless experience to all most
                        commonly used platforms - Windows, Linux, Web, Android and iOS.
