            Hey, I'm a software engineer primarily working with Python, TypeScript, Django, and Flutter.
            I'm always curious about different technologies, concepts and ideas, and have a particular interest in functional 
            programming and computer graphics. I also enjoy reading and diving into side projects in my 
            free time. Feel free to check out my side projects and work experience here.
