            I'm a software engineer passionate about building useful things 
            for the web. Curious about a broad range of technologies, concepts 
            and ideas, I have a particular interest in functional programming 
            and computer graphics. I also enjoy reading and working on side projects
            in my free time. Feel free to check out my side projects and work experience here.
