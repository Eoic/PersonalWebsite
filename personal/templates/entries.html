            <h3> <a class="link bordered" href="https://github.com/Eoic/Papyrus" target="blank"> Papyrus </a> - cross-platform e-book management system </h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I really like colecting books, both in physical and digital form, but none of the applications I used so far to track my collections met my expectations - Calible, Google Books, Amazon Kindle, Bookshelf, etc. Some of the main
                    paint points for me are:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Ugly user interface </li>
                    <li> Not available on multiple platforms (e.g. mobile, desktop) </li>
                    <li> Narrow file format support </li>
                    <li> File size limits </li>
                    <li> Cannot track physical books </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    By developing Papyrus I aim to address these issues and and some more interesting features like reading statistics, 
                    goal tracking, and potentially some social systems for book borrowing. Furthermore, I aim to bring seamless experience to all commonly used platforms - Windows, Linux, Web, Android and iOS.

            I enjoy collecting various excerpts of thoughts from posts, articles, books, videos, and more.
            Instead of maintaining disorganized lists on various note-taking and book-reading apps, I
            compile them all here — interesting, thought-provoking, amusing, silly, offensive, or any permutation of those.

                &ldquo;Asked by a French reporter what he regretted about the war, Jünger replied, “That we lost.” When a British newspaper later questioned him about Erich Remarque’s pacifist novel All Quiet on the Western Front—the antithesis of his own Storm of Steel—Jünger praised it as a handy piece of “camouflage”
                that made Germany seem like a country of peace-loving internationalists, which could now more effectively re-arm.&ldquo;

                &ldquo;The idea of the afterlife was created when the first protohumans became intelligent and self-aware
                enough to look around, notice that everyone eventually dies, and realize that you will not be an exception.
                That triggers the preservation instinct, which developed long before any hint of self-awareness as a way to escape
                immediate danger, so, naturally, our ancestors created a comforting lie to solve that inner conflict. That lie took many forms
                and grew into more complex shapes over millennia since, naturally, the biological roots of this problem are still here, but it
                doesn't matter if we talk about reincarnation, "the world beyond", returning to some spiritual "nature" - it's
                still the same lie. Always has been, always will be.&ldquo;
