                <div>
                    <p>
                        I really like collecting books, both in physical and digital form, but none of the applications
                        I used so far to track my collections met my expectations - Calible, Google Books, Amazon
                        Kindle, Bookshelf, etc. Some of the main
                        pain points for me are: ugly user interface, lack of support for multiple platforms, file size
                        limits, narrow file format support, no ability to manage physical books.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By developing Papyrus I aim to address these issues and add some more interesting features like
                        reading statistics,
                        goal tracking, and potentially some social systems for book borrowing. Furthermore, I aim to
                        bring seamless experience to all commonly used platforms - Windows, Linux, Web, Android and iOS.

                        Based on not so terribly exciting title, you can probably guess what this is about. Anyway, the
                        idea is a colony management
                        game, something like <a class="link bordered" href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"> Dwarf
                            Fortress </a> but in 3D, with multiplayer and focus on highly dynamic
                        environment (e.g. liquid simulation, plant growth, weather).

                I enjoy collecting various excerpts of thoughts from posts, articles, books, videos, and more.
                Instead of maintaining disorganized lists on various note-taking and book-reading apps, I
                compile them all here — interesting, thought-provoking, amusing, silly, offensive, or any permutation of
                those.

                    &ldquo;Asked by a French reporter what he regretted about the war, Jünger replied, “That we lost.”
                    When a British newspaper later questioned him about Erich Remarque’s pacifist novel All Quiet on the
                    Western Front—the antithesis of his own Storm of Steel—Jünger praised it as a handy piece of
                    “camouflage”
                    that made Germany seem like a country of peace-loving internationalists, which could now more
                    effectively re-arm.&ldquo;

                    &ldquo;The idea of the afterlife was created when the first protohumans became intelligent and
                    self-aware
                    enough to look around, notice that everyone eventually dies, and realize that you will not be an
                    exception.
                    That triggers the preservation instinct, which developed long before any hint of self-awareness as a
                    way to escape
                    immediate danger, so, naturally, our ancestors created a comforting lie to solve that inner
                    conflict. That lie took many forms
                    and grew into more complex shapes over millennia since, naturally, the biological roots of this
                    problem are still here, but it
                    doesn't matter if we talk about reincarnation, "the world beyond", returning to some spiritual
                    "nature" - it's
                    still the same lie. Always has been, always will be.&ldquo;
